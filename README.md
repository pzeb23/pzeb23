### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am a passionate Machine Learning Engineer


ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on web API's for data science projects.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning computer vision & deep learning algorithms.

- The current Machine Learning project deployed as a Docker image can be found here: https://backend-services-hydro.azurewebsites.net (2 min first startup time)


ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on various data science projects.
ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with reaching new clients through business connections. 
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about web API's, Machine Learning or software development best practices.
